Selfmedicate - Antidote's Development Environment
=================================================

If you want to contribute some lessons, you'll probably want to find a way to run them locally
yourself before opening a pull request. Or maybe you're looking to show some automation demos
in an environment that doesn't have internet access (hello federal folks). If any of this describes
you, you've come to the right place.

The antidote project is meant to run on top of Kubernetes. Not only does this provide a suitable
deployment environment for the Antidote platform itself, it also allows us to easily spin up additional
compute resources for running the lessons themselves. To replicate the production environment at
a smaller scale, such as on a laptop, we use "minikube". This is a single-node Kubernetes cluster
that is fairly well-automated. This means you can do things like run demos of Antidote lessons
offline, or use this as your development environment for building new lessons.

The `selfmedicate <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate>`_ tool is a set of scripts
that use minikube to deploy a full functioning Antidote deployment on your local machine.

.. warning::
    Currently, selfmedicate only supports mac and linux. If you want to run this on Windows, we
    recommend executing these scripts from within a linux virtual machine, or within 
    `Windows WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq>`_.

.. warning::

    The ``selfmedicate`` script is designed to make it easy to configure a local minikube environment
    with everything related to Antidote installed on top. However, you'll always be well-served by
    becoming familiar with ``minikube`` itself so that you are more able to troubleshoot the environment
    when things go wrong. Keep a bookmark to the `minikube docs <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/>`_ handy, just in case.

Install and Configure Dependencies
----------------------------------

The development environment runs within a virtual machine, so you'll need a hypervisor. We recommend
`Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ as it is widely supported across operating systems
as well as the automation we'll use to get everything spun up on top of it.

Next, you'll need minikube. This is by far the easiest way to get a working instance of Kubernetes
running on your laptop. Follow the `installation instructions <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/>`_
to install, but do not start minikube.

.. warning::

    The currently supported version of minikube is v0.34.1. Please install this version specifically. You may
    encounter issues with other versions.

.. note:: 

    The ``selfmedicate`` script starts a minikube VM with 8GB of RAM and 4 vCPUs by default. While this isn't a strict
    requirement, it's a highly advised minimum. Depending on the lessons you start, it can require quite a bit of system
    resources, especially if you start multiple lessons in parallel.

Starting the Environment
------------------------

All of the scripts and kubernetes manifests for running Antidote within minikube are located in the
`antidote-selfmedicate <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate>`_ repository.Clone and enter this repository::

    git clone https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate && cd antidote-selfmedicate/

**Please remember** that changes are being made to this repository all the time. If you encounter issues, the
very first thing you should try before you open an issue is to make sure you have the latest copy of this
repository by doing a ``git pull`` on the master branch.

.. note::  By default, the selfmedicate script will look at the relative path ``../antidote`` for
           your lesson directory, and automatically share those files to the development environment.
           If this location doesn't exist, either place the appropriate repository there, or edit the
           ``LESSON_DIRECTORY`` variable at the top of ``selfmedicate.sh``.

Within this repo, the ``selfmedicate.sh`` script is our one-stop shop for managing the development environment. This script
interacts with minikube for us, so we don't have to. Only in rare circumstances, such as troubleshooting
problems, should you have to interact directly with minikube. This script has several subcommands:

.. CODE::

    ./selfmedicate.sh -h
    Usage: selfmedicate.sh <subcommand> [options]
    Subcommands:
        start    Start local instance of Antidote
        reload   Reload Antidote components
        stop     Stop local instance of Antidote
        resume   Resume stopped Antidote instance

    options:
    -h, --help                show brief help

To initially start the selfmedicate environment, use the ``start`` subcommand, like so:

.. CODE::

    ./selfmedicate.sh start

The output of this script should be fairly descriptive, but a high-level overview of the four tasks
accomplished by the ``selfmedicate`` script in this stage is as follows:

1. ``minikube`` is instructed to start a Kubernetes cluster with a variety of optional arguments that
   are necessary to properly run the Antidote platform
2. Once a basic Kubernetes cluster is online, some additional infrastructure elements are installed. These
   include things like Multus and Weave, to enable the advanced networking needed by lessons.
3. Platform elements like ``syringe`` and ``antidote-web`` are installed onto the minikube instance.
4. Common and large images, like the ``vqfx`` and ``utility`` images are pre-emptively downloaded to the
   minikube instance, so that you don't have to wait for these to download when you try to spin up a lesson.
5. Once all the above is done, the script will ask for your sudo password so it can automatically add an entry
   to ``/etc/hosts`` for you. Once this is done, you should be able to access the environment at the URL
   shown.

.. WARNING::

    Each of these steps are performed in sequence, and will wait for everything to finish before moving on to the
    next step. This script is designed to do as much work as possible up-front, so that your development experience
    can be as positive as possible. As a result, the first time you run this command can take some time. BE PATIENT.
    Also note that if you destroy your minikube instance, you'll need to redo all of the above. If you want to just
    temporarily pause your environment, see the section below on the ``stop`` and ``resume`` subcommands.

The below screenshot shows this command in action, for your reference. You should see more or less the same thing
on your environment.

.. image:: /images/selfmedicate.png

Once this is done, the environment should be ready to access at the URL shown by the script.

Iterating on Lessons
--------------------

One of the biggest use cases for running ``selfmedicate`` is to provide a local instance of the antidote platform for
building and testing curriculum contributions. As was briefly mentioned in the ``start`` section above, the ``selfmedicate``
script takes care of mapping the files on your local filesystem into minikube and again into the Syringe pod to ensure
it sees the lessons you're working on.

This means you can work on lessons all on your local machine without having to bother editing environment variables or
committing your content to a Git repository.

Once you have a working antidote installation according to the previous section, you'll notice that the web portal shows the lessons
as they existed when you initially started the platform. If you want to apply any changes you've made locally, you need to run the
``reload`` subcommand of the ``selfmedicate`` script:

.. code::

    ./selfmedicate.sh reload

This command will take care of restarting Syringe, so that it can reload the content you've changed on your filesystem.

Pausing and Resuming Environment
--------------------------------

As mentioned above, if you destroy the minikube environment, you'll need to perform the ``start`` command all over again.
However, it would be nice to be able to stop the environment temporarily, and resume later without installing everything
over again from scratch.

Fortunately, the ``stop`` and ``resume`` subcommands do just this for us. To stop/pause the environment, run:

.. code::

    ./selfmedicate.sh stop

To resume, run:

.. code::

    ./selfmedicate.sh resume

The ``resume`` command is important to run, since this re-executes minikube with the optional arguments needed by Antidote,
so make sure to use this, rather than trying to use ``minikube start`` directly.

Troubleshooting Self-Medicate
-----------------------------

The vast majority of all setup activities are performed by the ``selfmedicate`` script. The idea is that this script shoulders
the burden of downloading all the appropriate software and building is so that you can quickly get to focusing on lesson content.

However, issues can still happen. This section is meant to direct you towards the right next steps should something go wrong and
you need to intervene directly.

.. note::

    If your issue isn't covered below, please `open an issue on the
    selfmedicate repository <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate/issues/new>`_.

Cannot connect to the Web Front-End
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's likely that the pods for running the Antidote platform aren't running yet. Try getting the current pods:

.. code::

    ~$ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    antidote-web-99c6b9d8d-pj55w                2/2     Running   0          12d
    nginx-ingress-controller-694479667b-v64sm   1/1     Running   0          12d
    syringe-fbc65bdf5-zf4l4                     1/1     Running   4          12d

You should see something similar to the above. The exact pod names will be different, but you should see the same numbers under
the ``READY`` column, and all entries under the ``STATUS`` column should read ``Running`` as above.


In some cases the ``STATUS`` column may read ``ContainerCreating``. In this case, it's likely that the images for each pod
is still being downloaded to your machine. You can verify this by "describing" the pod that's not ``Ready`` yet:

.. code::

    kubectl describe pods -n=kube-system kube-multus-ds-amd64-ddxqc
    Name:               kube-multus-ds-amd64-ddxqc
    ....truncated....
    Events:
    Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
    ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
    Normal  Scheduled  19s   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned kube-system/kube-multus-ds-amd64-ddxqc to minikube
    Normal  Pulling    17s   kubelet, minikube  pulling image "nfvpe/multus:latest"

In this example, we're still waiting for the image to download - the most recent event indicates that the image is being pulled.
The ``selfmedicate.sh`` script has some built-in logic to wait for these downloads to finish before moving to the next step,
but in case that doesn't work, this can help you understand what's going on behind the scenes.

If you're seeing something else, it's likely that something is truly broken, and you likely won't be able to get the environment
working without some kind of intervention. Please `open an issue on the antidote-selfmedicate repository <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate/issues/new>`_
with a full description of what you're seeing.

Lesson Times Out While Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you've managed to get into the web front-end, and you're able to navigate to a lesson, but the lesson just
hangs forever at the loading screen. Eventually you'll see some kind of error message that indicates the lesson timed
out while trying to start.

This can have a number of causes, but one of the most common is that the images used in a lesson failed to download within
the configured timeout window. This isn't totally uncommon, since the images tend to be fairly large, and on some internet
connections, this can take some time.

There are a few things you can try. For instance, ``kubectl describe pods <pod name>``, as used in the previous section,
can tell you if a given pod is still downloading an image.

We can also use the ``minikube ssh`` command to send commands into the minikube VM and see the results. For instance, to
check the list of docker images that have been successfully pulled:

.. note::

    minikube ssh docker image list

This is the same as running ``docker image list``, but it's done from inside the minikube VM for you. Similarly, if you wanted
to manually pull an image ahead of time, you could run ``minikube ssh docker image pull <image>``.

.. note::

  The ``selfmedicate`` script downloads the most common images in advance to try to reduce the likelihood of this issue, and to
  generally improve the responsiveness of the local environment. However, it can't do this for all possible images you might want
  to use. If you know you'll use a particular image commonly, consider adding it to the ``selfmedicate`` script, or manually
  pulling it within the minikube environment ahead of time.
