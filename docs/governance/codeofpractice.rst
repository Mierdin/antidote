The NRE Labs Code of Practice
=============================

The main purpose of this document is as a draft for the NRE Labs and Antidote Code of Practice - a 
document that clearly states what we stand for, and what you should agree to in order to be 
considered part of the community. It’s a statement about what drove us to create this, and why we
get out of bed every day. 

Given the dominance of the internet in our everyday lives, and increasingly distributed applications
(microservices), networking is arguably WAY MORE important now more than ever. So why are we thought
of as an archaic, old-hat discipline? Why is it that the rest of IT is seemingly moving forward without us?

For too long we as a network industry have prioritized products over progress. We've sold the soul of what 
makes us engineers and instead relied on canned solutions to do it for us, relegating us to lever pullers
We’ve outsourced the description of our value to vendor-driven certifications that - while valuable within
a certain context - fall short of describing the true and whole value of our skill-sets.

The mission of this initiative - the thing that makes us all tick - the thing that makes us wake up every
morning - is:

Making networking the envy of the IT discipline
We dream of a day when networking is the envy of the IT industry

Example of envy #1
Example of envy #2
Example of envy #3


You stand for progress or you don't. If you stand for progress - if this mission resonates with you, then
make the leap with us. Make the necessary sacrifices to move the industry forward. You make sacrifices. 

This is not an extension of a corporate marketing campaign, and that includes
Juniper Networks, the original sponsor for this curriculum. This is not pay for play. Rather, the currency 
of this project is good will. We are subsidizing the education of the community because we feel strongly
that networking can be made to be a technology leader once more, and this is us putting skin in the game
towards that mission.

We believe that the idea that networking is more important than ever and the sentiment that network engineers
are becoming an archaic, irrelevant group are mutually exclusive. It is impossible for those two things to be 
simultaneously true.

This is not a place for big companies to mooch off the community. This is a place for all organizations,
big or small, vendor and customers to meet in a place where marketing and sales are set aside for the good
of the networking discipline.

Be clear on what sacrifices we've made and what sacrifices we expect others to make

NRE Labs is a place where everyone - customer and vendor, can meet together in a safe space.

To meet here requires sacrifice. NRE Labs is about helping the industry move forward, and the currency of
these efforts is good will. So you have to demonstrate good will.

Need to start with more or less tangible rules around this but the long and short of it is a demonstration
of good will. You have to be willing to publish, in full, all of the resources needed to run your lesson. 

**Why NRE Labs?**

NRE Labs grew out of the experiences of working network engineers who were quick to see the value of embracing infrastructure automation for the purposes of network reliability engineering (“NRE”), but were challenged by the learning curve of doing so.

Many automation tools were initially designed for compute and storage automation; in addition much of the work in this area has been done in open source projects, with varying degrees of commercialization. In parallel, the “SDN revolution” initially produced a widely held belief that network engineers would need to become coders or become obsolete. 

The group of engineers who started NRE Labs believes strongly that expecting an entire profession to start over and learn programming from first principles is most likely to result in a general failure to adopt network automation at all, even as networking itself becomes ever more important in the basic functioning of distributed, multicloud operations.

NRE Labs has been an open source project from its inception--both the platform itself and all the lessons. The NRE Labs community seeks to ensure that anyone anywhere can quickly learn key automation concepts using whatever network equipment and tools they have available. Thus we encourage contributions from as broad a swath of the networking and automation communities as possible.  Anyone can contribute to any aspect of the project, according to the rules laid out in the governance document.  

**Mission and Scope**

We resolve to provide a platform for education in infrastructure automation tools and techniques for network engineers that can immediately be applied to real-world daily tasks. 

We encourage lessons of all types relating to network reliability engineering and infrastructure automation. All lessons should be concise and practical, focused on the mastery of a specific automation task.

The scope of the Project includes software development under an OSI-approved open source licence (currently Apache License 2.0) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source software project. 

**Values**

NRE Labs has always been open source and we expect it always will be.

We believe in putting the needs of our users and our community before our needs or those of our employers.

As an education-focused project, we believe above all in mentoring and helping to create the network reliability engineering leaders, and network-savvy open source leaders and contributors of the future.

We believe in supporting diversity in ideas and experiences in the course of developing the project platform and lessons. This means ensuring that discussions about the project are respectful and constructive at all times.
