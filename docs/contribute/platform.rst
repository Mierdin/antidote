Contributing to the Antidote Platform
=====================================

.. WARNING::

    **Under Construction**. If you want to propose a change to the Antidote platform,
    such as to Syringe or Antidote-web, you're welcome to do so, but right now we're putting
    all our energy into making sure the curriculum contribution experience is solid. So,
    the docs for this portion are still TBD. You're welcome to peruse the code and make contributions
    if you know what you're doing, or ask questions via the :ref:`community forums <community-forums>`,
    but this will be best-effort support while we finish getting the lesson contributor experience
    off the ground.
