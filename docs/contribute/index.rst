Contributing
============

Both the Antidote platform itself, and the NRE Labs curriculum are open source and contributions to either are welcome.
This set of documents will get you up to speed with everything you need to contribute to either area of the project.
Before starting your work, please read this section in its entirety, so your work has the maximum impact and your time is best spent.

.. NOTE::

    No one should feel like they have to get permission to contribute. There's no harm in you opening an Issue or Pull Request
    that you feel is valuable and is worthy of your time. This section of the docs is aimed at empowering you to do this on your own
    and get your contributions merged into the project.
