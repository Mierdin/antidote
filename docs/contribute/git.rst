Working with Antidote Git Repositories
======================================

The Antidote project does everything in the open. All configurations, curriculum resources, and source code
can be found in one of the GitHub repositories in the nre-learning organization. As a result, no matter where
you want to contribute to the Antidote project, you're likely able to do so by contributing to one of these repositories.

However, not everyone that wants to contribute knows how Git works, and even for those that do, the way the Antidote project uses Git to
accept contributions may not exactly match with previous experience. This document is aimed at covering everything you'll
need to know to contribute to any Antidote repository. Other pages within this documentation explain the specifics
of contributing to the curriculum, the underlying platform, the development environment, or even the documentation itself,
but they all have one common theme - at some point, in order to contribute, you will need to work with Git.

So, those pages will focus on the specific details and repositories they cover, but will inevitably link here. So,
this document will apply to any Git repository those pages might reference, even though we'll use some specific
examples here for illustrative purposes.
