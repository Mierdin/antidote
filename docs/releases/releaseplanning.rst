Release Planning
================================

WOW. Much WIP. Please forgive the brevity and informality of this page for now.

First we start with the miniprojects and the v1.0 timeline. Are there any milestones for the upcoming release we need to hit?

Second, we comb through the issues for the repos and triage accordingly. Which are ready to be worked on, or are most imminent?

Then, we create a work breakdown project board and start working things down.

Once finished, we run the release workflow. Very shortly, we make the release available via PTR for a week of testing

After a week of testing, provided there are no major issues, we update prod as well.
