Curricula
=========

Syringe uses a totally file-driven approach to representing a curriculum. All aspects of a curriculum are managed
as "code" within a Git repository, instead of in a database. This way, all lessons, collections, etc can be seen
at-a-glance within a Git repository as plain files. This is where the idea of curriculum-as-code is made
possible.

In the remainder of this document, we'll outline the types of resources that can be contained within a
curriculum, and link to other resources within the Antidote documentation that will help you build, or
contribute to an existing curriculum.
