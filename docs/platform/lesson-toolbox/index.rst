The Lesson Builder's Toolbox
============================

Antidote is a platform for bringing otherwise complicated technical learning material to the masses,
by taking care of the complexity behind the scenes, out of sight of the learner.
To that end, there are a variety of tools we make available to you, the lesson author / teacher
to make this possible.

Some tools are designed to make things easier to teach, others makes things easier
to learn, other things do both. Please read through this portion of the
documentation so you don't miss out on any useful tools you can leverage
to really make your content stand out.
