NRE Labs Curriculum Terminology
=======================================

Taxonomy
---------------

In any Antidote curriculum there are several courses. A course is a theme and
grouping of many related lessons. A lesson is a common task or workflow of
many small steps. A lab is one small step or several that can be explained
easily so that a user can understand and accomplish the labs in a matter of
minutes.

Here is the hierarchy overview:

* Curriculum: the whole thing (NRE Labs)
* Category: A topic of study
* Lessons: A set of exercises that make sense together to teach something with
  a common set of resources. Usually a NetOps task.
* Labs (sometimes referred to as stages): A set of related steps forming a workflow in a Lesson

Lesson and Lab Relationship
------------------------------

The spirit of the NRE Labs curriculum is that it is supposed to be fast, easy
and fun to use.  Labs should not take long to complete, so a Lesson is usually
made up of a handful or more Labs, broken up logically to accomplish this goal.
This is manifested in the Antidote web interface using the dropdown at the top
of every lesson:

Lessons are designed to solve a problem various ways to maximize learning. It
is helpful to think of solving the same workflow different ways with different
kinds of Labs. That way in one Lesson or Course we teach several ways of doing
something, and different skills. We can reason about automating workflows
into a Lab in the following ways:

* On-box and Off-box
* Single or Multi step
* Single or Multi node
* Going direct-to-box or going through an higher-level controller or collector
* Sequential/Serial/Synchronous or In-Parallel/Asynchronous (like map-reduce)

Categories
------------

This is, perhaps, the most in-flux portion of the NRE Labs curriculum.
So, while this is subject to change in the near future, the categories
are currently:

1. Fundamentals
2. Tools
3. Workflows

However, this is just to get things started. We're constantly thinking of better
ways to categorize curriculum content so you can find what you are looking for.
