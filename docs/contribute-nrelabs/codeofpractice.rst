The NRE Labs Code of Practice
=============================


The main purpose of this document is as a draft for the NRE Labs and Antidote Code of Practice - a 
document that clearly states what we stand for, and what you should agree to in order to be 
considered part of the community. It’s a statement about what drove us to create this, and why we
get out of bed every day. 

Given the dominance of the internet in our everyday lives, and increasingly distributed applications
(microservices), networking is arguably WAY MORE important now more than ever. So why are we thought
of as an archaic, old-hat discipline? Why is it that the rest of IT is seemingly moving forward without us?

For too long we as a network industry have prioritized products over progress. We've sold the soul of what 
makes us engineers and instead relied on canned solutions to do it for us, relegating us to lever pullers
We’ve outsourced the description of our value to vendor-driven certifications that - while valuable within
a certain context - fall short of describing the true and whole value of our skill-sets.

The mission of this initiative - the thing that makes us all tick - the thing that makes us wake up every
morning - is:

Making networking the envy of the IT discipline
We dream of a day when networking is the envy of the IT industry

Example of envy #1
Example of envy #2
Example of envy #3


You stand for progress or you don't. If you stand for progress - if this mission resonates with you, then
make the leap with us. Make the necessary sacrifices to move the industry forward. You make sacrifices. 

This is not an extension of a corporate marketing campaign, and that includes
Juniper Networks, the original sponsor for this curriculum. This is not pay for play. Rather, the currency 
of this project is good will. We are subsidizing the education of the community because we feel strongly
that networking can be made to be a technology leader once more, and this is us putting skin in the game
towards that mission.

We believe that the idea that networking is more important than ever and the sentiment that network engineers
are becoming an archaic, irrelevant group are mutually exclusive. It is impossible for those two things to be 
simultaneously true.

This is not a place for big companies to mooch off the community. This is a place for all organizations,
big or small, vendor and customers to meet in a place where marketing and sales are set aside for the good
of the networking discipline.

Be clear on what sacrifices we've made and what sacrifices we expect others to make

NRE Labs is a place where everyone - customer and vendor, can meet together in a safe space.

To meet here requires sacrifice. NRE Labs is about helping the industry move forward, and the currency of
these efforts is good will. So you have to demonstrate good will.

Need to start with more or less tangible rules around this but the long and short of it is a demonstration
of good will. You have to be willing to publish, in full, all of the resources needed to run your lesson.
