The NRE Labs Accords
====================

For too long we as a network industry have prioritized products over progress. We've sold the soul of what makes us

Rules





NRE Labs is a place where everyone - customer and vendor, can meet together in a safe space.

You need to demonstrate, as a company (especially large companies with more resources) a willingness to contribute meaningfully to the community without making part of a direct revenue-generating efffort on your part.
